methodology:
 - visualize the data to get an idea of the distributions
 > the first part of the story
 > I decided to use histograms as they display distributions well and
   there is no date column for other charts such as line to make sense

notes:

 - letter naming fluency and phoneme segmentation fluency
 > they both contain normal distributions, with the highest point residing at 
   scores of 30-40
 > we can perform a linear regression on the two to test if a relationship exists
 > the results have a p-value of of 6.39E-16, so there's an extremely small chance
   that the relationship between these scores is due to random chance
 >> this makes sense, due to the fundamental nature of phonemes and letter naming
 >>> letter naming is recognizing letter shapes and associating them with the letter
     name, while phonemes are is the smallest unit of sound that distinguishes one
     word from another
 methodology:
  - I used PNF as the independent variable and LNF as the dependent variable

 - Nonsense Word Fluency-Correct Letter Sounds and Oral Reading Fluency
 > both are heavily skewed to the left, displaying that many students struggle
 > because both measures relate to students' ability to read words and sounds,
   we can assume the scores will be related
 > I tested null hypothesis with a regression, which resulted in a p-value of 1.6E-36
 > based on the analysis, the relationship is not likely due to random chance
methodology:
 - I used NWF-CLS as the independent variable and ORF as the dependent variable

 - oral reading fluency accuracy
 > the distribution is skewed at the lower end, but is relatively flat there 
   after with a modest rise up to the 2nd quintile
 >> I read this as once students pass that first hump, they improve well after

 - oral reading fluency and word reading fluency
 > both have scores skewed toward the bottom
 > correlation resulted in 0.97 which shows a significant relationship
 >> this may be due to the fact that if a student has trouble reading words, then they're
    more than likely going to have trouble reading out loud
